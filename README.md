My very first AR apps that I created when ARKit was first introduced.
Utilizes ARKit 1.0.
Spawns a 3d cross-section of a place in AR.
3D scenery is created out of a depth map and an overlay that was aligned and cropped from google maps were used to create this.
Map overlay is from google maps and the depth map is from Tangrams heightmapper.
